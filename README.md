# 🙏 Acknowledgements
This project was developed as part of a Laravel Job Interview Task.
I've put my full effort into making this application professional, complete, and beyond the given requirements (including bonus features like full CRUD, search, and real-time validation).
Thanks for taking the time to review Course Craft!
